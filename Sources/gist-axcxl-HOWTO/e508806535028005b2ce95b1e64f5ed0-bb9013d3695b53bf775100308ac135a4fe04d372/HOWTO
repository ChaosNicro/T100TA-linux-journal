# Puppy Linux

RESULT: no wireless out of the box with BionicPup64 8.0, device does not show up in lspci either (hw kill switch?)

How to install:
- download image http://puppylinux.com/index.html#download
- format USB drive with FAT32 partition
- using Unetbootin, write iso to formatted USB drive
- download Grub2 UEFI 32-bit version from here http://distro.ibiblio.org/fatdog/packages/700/grub2-efi32-2.00-i686-1.txz [1]
- extract the tarball from previous step, find grubia32.efi and rename it to bootia32.efi
- on the USB drive create EFI/boot folder
- put bootia32.efi in EFI/boot folder on USB drive

NOTE: use Unetbootin instead of Etcher or dd to be able to edit the partition after - it is similar to Rufus ISO mode.

How to boot [2]:
- plug in USB
- power up tablet
- enter BIOS on tablet (with docking station, hit F2 or ESC at boot)
- disable secure boot

How to fix the wireless:
- download https://github.com/Asus-T100/firmware/blob/master/brcm/brcmfmac43340-sdio.txt
- copy to /lib/firmware/brcm
- modprobe -r brcmfmac
- modprobe brcmfmac

# Install to hdd
- did not write the exact steps, but just a few notes
- created EFI FAT32 partition and ext4 normal partition
- installed via script to ext4 partition (scripts said boot would not work, ignored)
- copied EFI/boot/bootia32.efi (keeping folder struct) folder from USB and: grub.cfg, initrd.gz, ldlinux.sys, vmlinuz from ext4 partition to EFI partition 
- using `pmedia=cd pfix=nocopy` (do not copy sfs to RAM)
- after boot and save everything works ok, no further problems
- NOTE: use x64 packet versions!

# Other problems
## SSH
- use Dropbear, easier to install and start: install, dropbear -R to generate the keys, service dropbear start
- to login: root/woofwoof
- not sure how to change the password, so simply disabled password logins by adding -s param to dropbear params (edited /etc/init.d/dropbear direcly, need to investigate correct way to do it

## Brightness
- to set it use `xrandr --output DSI-1 --brightness 0.5`
- see [3] for more details and a .pet for a taskbar control

## Keepass2
- to get it working `ln -s /usr/bin/mono /usr/bin/cli` [4]

## Screen rotation
- for now testing [5] with the following set:
TOUCHPAD='Asus Touchpad'
TOUCHSCREEN='SIS0817...' (get output from xinput)

## On screen keyboard
- install xvkbd if not already installed
- to config, set things in /etc/X11/app-defaults/XVkbd-common
- increased size: `XVkbd.geometry: 1000x300`
- removed keypad and function keys: `xvkbd.compact: true`
